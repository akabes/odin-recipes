    <p>
    This recipe is pure bliss, a bit on the expensive side, but easy, flavorful, and worth every penny. <br>
    I try and purchase most/all items in an asian supermarket, as I know they will have everything, and tend to sell chilean sea bass at a cheaper price per pound. <br>
    Be sure to only buy as much as you need, this fish is not cheap!

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>24 oz Chilean Seabass</li>
        <li>1 cup sweet white miso paste</li>
        <li>3 TBSP. dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sake</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mirin japanese rice wine)</li>
        <li>Oil</li>


    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in pot (besides fish)</li>
        <li>Allow to simmer for 20 minutes, cool completely.</li>
        <li>Smother on fish and allow to marinate for at least 2 hours (overnight would be better)</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to broil.</li>
        <li>Wipe off marinade with paper towel and lightly brush with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Broil until nice and dark on top.</li>
        <li>Check for doneness and allow to rest.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Be sure to cut fish into portions prior to cooking/serving <br>
    if you are purchasing a large piece. A great trick, if you do not want to <br>
    struggle with wiping off the marinate when it is time to cook, <br>
    is to wrap the fish in cheesecloth and than coat with marinate. <br>
    The fish will still soak up all the delicious flavors overnight <br>
     and allow you to simply unwrap and cook whenever you're ready.</p>
