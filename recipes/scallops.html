    <p> An amazing scallop dish with a powerful Szechwan sauce. You should have some sauce left over, <br>
    but don't worry you will find yourself dunking anything you could find in it, it's that good!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 -1" piece fresh ginger (peeled and quartered)</li>
        <li>4 large garlic cloves (cut into chunks)</li>
        <li>2 scallions, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 TBSP. vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2- tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>

        <li>1/2 tsp. sesame oil</li>
        <li>13-16 Sea Scallops (cleaned! be sure to peel off the small muscle on the side, it is chewy and tough )
        </li>


 </ul>
<h2> Directions:</h2>
 <ol>
        <li>Combine: ginger, garlic, and scallion in food processor, coarsely chop. Leave in food processor for now. <br>
            Meanwhile, in a bowl combine red pepper, sugar, soy sauce, ketchup, wine, vinegar, & sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil to medium heat in a heavy bottomed skillet. Add ginger, garlic, and scallion, <br>
            turn to low and stir frequently. Do not allow to brown , cook for 1-2 minutes, until strong garlic scent has diminished. <br>
            Add your liquid ingredients to the pan while stirring, allow to simmer for an additional 1-2 minutes.</li>  
        <li>Take your scallops out of the fridge about 20 minutes prior to sautéing to prevent sticking. <br>
            Heat sauté pan on high, add oil to lightly cover bottom. Allow to heat to near smoking point. <br>
            DRY scallops thoroughly with paper towel, brush with olive oil, and season with S+P.</li> 
        <li>Add scallops to pan, do not touch/move for 2-3 minutes or until crust forms. Flip and repeat. <br>
            If the pan starts to smoke heavily, be sure to turn down the flame.</li>
        <li>Do the sauce in advance, and reheat if you want to make dinner a breeze, but be sure to cook the scallops right before serving, <br>
        </li>
